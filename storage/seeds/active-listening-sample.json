Before that she was at a startup called Velocity for 18 months. She mentioned she left because they pivoted away from infrastructure work, which is what she wants to focus on.\n\nShe's looking for $165K base, which is higher than our range, but she said she's flexible on equity. Her notice period is three weeks, not the standard two. She specifically asked about our deployment frequency—said her current team ships twice a month and she wants to move faster.\n\nOne thing that stood out: she's worked with Kubernetes extensively at DataCore but only dabbled with it at Velocity. She's never led a team but she's mentored two junior engineers. And she really emphasized she wants to stay technical—made it clear three times she's not interested in management track.",

Our fiscal year ends June 30th, so we need phase one completed by April 15th to get phase two approved before the budget cycle closes.\n\nOne more thing—we can do $450K this fiscal year and roll $100K into next year's budget, or we can do the full $550K this year if you can guarantee completion by June 15th. Our previous consultant burned through $300K and delivered nothing, so the board is really skeptical about bringing in outside help again.",

We send materials 48 hours in advance, not 12.\n\nSecond issue: the pricing on slide 14 showed $340K when we'd verbally discussed $380K with their VP. I had to correct it in the meeting. That's not a good look. And you included case studies from the healthcare vertical when they specifically said they wanted tech company examples.\n\nThe presentation itself was solid—your delivery was confident, the design was clean. But you missed three of their four questions during Q&A. When they asked about integration timelines, you said 'a few weeks' instead of giving them the 6-8 week range we discussed. And you forgot to mention we have SOC 2 compliance when they brought up security.\n\nThe good news is they're still interested, but we need to tighten up your prep process.",

Triglycerides are 245, which is high—we want that below 150. Your A1C is 5.9, which puts you in the prediabetic range.\n\nHere's what I recommend: Start with 10mg of atorvastatin daily, take it at night with food. We'll recheck your levels in 8 weeks, not 12 like we usually do, because I want to catch this early. If the statin doesn't bring your LDL down by at least 30 points, we'll increase to 20mg.\n\nDiet changes: Cut saturated fat to less than 7% of daily calories. Increase omega-3s—aim for fatty fish twice a week. And you really need to get your exercise up to 150 minutes per week of moderate activity. Right now you're doing what, maybe 45 minutes?\n\nOne more thing: call me immediately if you experience muscle pain or weakness while on the statin. That's rare but it happens. And no grapefruit juice—it interferes with the medication. Your next appointment is March 22nd at 2:30pm.",

Built in 1987, fully renovated in 2019. Square footage is 2,400, but that doesn't include the finished basement, which adds another 600 square feet.\n\nProperty taxes are $14,200 annually. HOA is $185 per month, covers exterior maintenance and the community pool. Roof was replaced in 2021, should be good for another 15-20 years. HVAC system is original from the renovation, so 2019.\n\nThe sellers are motivated—they've already bought in Portland and are carrying two mortgages. Their realtor told me they'd entertain offers between $825K and $850K. They want to close by April 30th because that's when their Portland mortgage rate lock expires.\n\nOne thing to know: the previous buyers' inspection found some settling in the foundation—not structural, but it'll cost about $8K to repair. Sellers agreed to cover half of that. And the appliances in the kitchen stay except the washer and dryer, those are going with them.",

We have 47 paying customers—average contract value is $28K annually.\n\nWe're raising a $4M Series A. We've already got $2.5M committed from Construct Ventures and two angels. We're allocating $1.8M to sales and marketing, $1.5M to product development, and keeping $700K for operations and runway extension.\n\nOur burn rate is currently $180K per month. This raise gives us 22 months of runway, but we'll be cash-flow positive in 14 months if we hit our targets. We're targeting general contractors with 50-200 employees—too small and they won't pay, too large and they've already got enterprise solutions.\n\nOur biggest competitor is Procore, but they're focused on enterprise customers at $100K+ contracts. We're going after the mid-market they ignore. Two of our customers switched from them because we're easier to implement and one-third the cost. We launched in Texas, now expanding to Arizona and Colorado this quarter.",

Your annual bonus target is 20% of base, but it's discretionary, not guaranteed.\n\nEquity is 12,000 options at a $2.50 strike price, vesting over 4 years with a 1-year cliff. That means nothing vests in year one, then 25% vests at 12 months, and the rest vests monthly after that. If you leave before the cliff, you get zero.\n\nNon-compete clause is 12 months, not the 18 months you saw in the first draft—I negotiated that down. But it covers any company in the HR tech space within the US. There's also a non-solicit for 24 months—you can't recruit any employees or contractors you worked with.\n\nNotice period is 30 days unless terminated for cause, then it's immediate. Severance is 2 months base salary if they terminate you without cause, but only if you sign a release. And there's a clawback provision—if you're terminated for cause within the first year, you have to repay 50% of the signing bonus.\n\nPTO is 20 days annually but doesn't roll over. Health insurance starts immediately, 401k match is 4% but doesn't start until month 3.",

You're clear to go home but someone needs to stay with you for the next 24 hours and wake you every 3 hours, not every hour—we don't want to disrupt your sleep too much.\n\nI'm prescribing 600mg ibuprofen every 6 hours as needed for pain. Don't exceed 3,200mg in 24 hours. No aspirin or other NSAIDs on top of this. You can also use ice packs for 15 minutes at a time, but wait at least 2 hours between applications.\n\nReturn to the ER immediately if you experience any of these: vomiting more than twice, severe headache that doesn't respond to the ibuprofen, confusion or slurred speech, vision changes, or clear fluid draining from your nose or ears. That last one especially—that could indicate a CSF leak.\n\nNo driving for 48 hours. No alcohol for 72 hours—it can interact with the head injury. You can return to work in 3 days if you're symptom-free, but no intense physical activity for a full week.\n\nFollow up with your primary care doctor in 5 days, sooner if symptoms worsen. Your CT scan images are being sent to them automatically. Any questions?",

The venue rental is $8,500 and that includes the space from 2pm to midnight—any earlier setup or later breakdown is $200 per hour.\n\nWe provide tables and chairs for up to 200 guests—anything beyond that is $12 per chair, $45 per table. We have a required catering list of 4 approved vendors—you must use one of them, no outside catering allowed. Bar service is separate, and there's a required $2,000 minimum bar spend, plus 20% service fee and 8% tax on top of that.\n\nParking is included for 60 cars. We have an overflow lot 3 blocks away with 40 additional spaces. Valet service is available for $600 flat rate, covers up to 100 cars. You need to provide your own liability insurance—minimum $2 million coverage—or purchase it through us for $400.\n\nFinal payment is due 30 days before the event. We require a $2,500 non-refundable deposit to hold the date. Cancellations more than 90 days out, you lose the deposit. Less than 90 days, you lose the deposit plus 50% of the venue fee.\n\nOne more thing: we have a noise ordinance. Music has to be at reasonable levels after 10pm, and completely off by 11pm—not midnight. The county is strict about this.",

Not terrible, but you can't wait on this. If a bearing seizes while you're driving, you could lose control of the vehicle.\n\nI also noticed your brake pads are at about 20%—you've got maybe 3,000 miles left, maybe 4,000 if you're gentle. Replacing all four is $480. You could wait a month or two, but once you're doing the bearings you might as well do the brakes since we'll have the wheels off anyway. Saves you $120 in labor if you do them together.\n\nYour rear shocks are leaking—see this oil here? Those are $340 each plus $200 labor, so $880 total. That one you can wait on if money's tight. It's affecting your ride quality but it's not a safety issue yet. Give it 6 months max before they need to be done.\n\nI can have everything done by tomorrow afternoon if you authorize it today. Just the bearings is 3 hours of work. Add the brakes and shocks, we're looking at 6 hours total. My shop rate is $140 per hour, but like I said, combining the jobs saves you on labor.\n\nWhat do you want to do?",
